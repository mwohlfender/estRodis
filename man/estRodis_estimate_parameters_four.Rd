\description{
\code{estRodis_estimate_parameters_four()} estimates the effective reproduction number and
the dispersion parameter based on the size distribution of identical sequence clusters.
}
\details{
The core of the function \code{estRodis_estimate_parameters_four()} is a mathematical model
of the size distribution of sequence clusters, in which viral transmission,
the mutation of the virus, and incomplete case-detection are integrated.
Parameters are estimated by a Bayesian inference model implemented in Stan.
The effective reproduction number and the dispersion parameter are included into the model with prior distributions.
The testing probability and the sequencing probability are included into
the model as fixed parameters.
